## Data Source
Chicago Taxi Trip datasets was extracted using the [Chicago Data Portal API Endpoint](https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/wrvz-psew.json) with the columns recording information on trip start and end date time, trip in seconds, trip in miles, pickup and dropoff community area, fare, tips, payment type, company, pickup and dropoff locations. 

Community area data that contains the pickup and dropoff community area name was used to enriched the Chicago Taxi trip data.
